/**
 * @dev Based on: https://github.com/indexed-finance/dividends/blob/master/contracts/base/AbstractDividends.sol
 * Renamed dividends to rewards.
 * @dev (OLD) Many functions in this contract were taken from this repository:
 * https://github.com/atpar/funds-distribution-token/blob/master/contracts/FundsDistributionToken.sol
 * which is an example implementation of ERC 2222, the draft for which can be found at
 * https://github.com/atpar/funds-distribution-token/blob/master/EIP-DRAFT.md
 *
 * This contract has been substantially modified from the original and does not comply with ERC 2222.
 * Many functions were renamed as "rewards" rather than "funds" and the core functionality was separated
 * into this abstract contract which can be inherited by anything tracking ownership of reward shares.
